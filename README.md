# 🖖 Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

A console-based **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock** game built in Python, where a human player can challenge various computer opponents.

This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, along with **user input handling** and **different automated player strategies**.
